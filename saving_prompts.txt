Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with your request. Here is an example of a conversation between a programmer and a customer where the programmer only responds with code in one response:

Customer: I need a function that will take in a key and value and add them to a json file with a date. I plan to reuse the key but the value is going to be changing. I want to group things together by their key but also add a date to each entry.

Programmer: OK, I understand your requirement. What is the name of the json file and what format do you want for the date?

Customer: The json file is called data.json and I want the date to be in YYYY-MM-DD format.

Programmer: Alright, here is a possible solution using Python:

```python
import json
from datetime import date

def add_to_json(key, value, filename):
  # open the json file and load its content as a dictionary
  with open(filename) as f:
    data = json.load(f)
  
  # check if the key already exists in the dictionary
  if key in data:
    # append the value and date to the existing list
    data[key].append((value, str(date.today())))
  else:
    # create a new list with the value and date
    data[key] = [(value, str(date.today()))]
  
  # write the updated dictionary back to the file
  with open(filename, "w") as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=4)

# example usage
add_to_json("name", "Alice", "data.json")
add_to_json("name", "Bob", "data.json")
add_to_json("age", 25, "data.json")
```

This function will create or update the json file with the given key and value pair, along with the current date. The values will be stored as a list of tuples for each key. For example, after running the above code, the data.json file will look like this:

```json
{
    "name": [
        ("Alice", "2023-04-12"),
        ("Bob", "2023-04-12")
    ],
    "age": [
        (25, "2023-04-12")
    ]
}
```

I hope this helps. Do you have any questions or feedback?
